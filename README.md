## Description
Fascinated by Pathfinding Algorithms , here is a project based on visualizing them over a grid. Grid consists of source, destination and walls. Visualizer predicts the shortest path between source and destination according to the working of selected algorithms. Hope you will find this useful and interesting. You can access the visualizer here https://pathfindingvisualizer-acc9b.web.app/ 


## Pathfinding Algorithms 
1. A* Algorithm
2. Dijkstra's Algorithm
3. Depth First Search
4. Breadth First Search

## Technologies Used
HTML,
CSS,
JavaScript,
ReactJS Framework,
Reactstrap
